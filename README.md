# GBVSFrameBot
A granblue versus frame data bot. Courtesy of Dustloop.

# Setup
To run the bot, create your own local dotnet.core project and copy the repository into the main directory.
Add a common folder to your netcoreapp folder, and inside create a JSON config file. You will need to list your token and prefixes here. All necessary components will be generated on compile time (you may need to restore the project when importing the dependencies).

# Side Notes
The database will not be populated. Create your own database or if needed by visiting https://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page or contact a Dustloop administrator.
