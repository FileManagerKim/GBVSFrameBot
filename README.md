# GBVSFrameBot
A granblue versus frame data discord bot built with the Discord.Net API.

# Setup
First, create your own local .NetCore project and clone the repository into the newly created project's main directory, replacing any duplicate folders and files. Try debugging to see if you will receive a token error.

To resolve the token error, add a <common> folder to your <netcoreapp> folder (<netcoreapp> can be generated by running the debugger), and inside create a JSON config file labeled "config.txt". You will need to list your token and prefix parameters here.

All other necessary components will be generated on compile time, including the database and the entity migration data. Note that you may need to restore the project to import the dependencies.

# Side Notes
GBVSFrameBot uses a SQLite database. The database will not be populated with entries by default but will be generated empty on compile. Scrape your own data, or visit https://www.dustloop.com/forums/ and contact a Dustloop administrator for a database/excel file that can be imported.

# Special Thanks
To the discord .net discord channel. 
Dustloop in general.
